The following are the improvements:

1. There are no open ended prompts. User can freely talk and the system can understand mostly.
2. There is no alignment on which you need to say. You can just say only from city or to city or date on which you travel.
   But the system rigjhtly asks for the necesseray details you miss to say.
3. Additional prompts to let the user know what is expected from him in case he did not respond properly.
4. No input is taken twice. 
5. The reservation is not complete until all the details are gathered.
6. Additional checks to see if to and from city are similar and re prompting if they are same.
